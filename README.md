# Background
I was watching reels on Facebook when a reel about car accident popped up. What was funny about this accident was that it was not coincidental. The driver ahead kept braking, on the highway. It didnt make sense because it was on the fast lane. When the car behind tried to overtake it, it would make sure that it doesn't pass. Up until it hit the brakes and the car behind hit it. You may wonder how I saw this, the car behind had a dashcam. I also went through the comments and discovered that this is a common scam of vehicle insurance claims. And then it hit me, what if the car behind did not have a dashcam? How could we know that a claim is fraudulent or not? What makes a claim fraudulent?
